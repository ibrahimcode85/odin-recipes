    <p>These pasta recipes are simple Italian classics you'll find in trattorias 
       all across Italy. “Pantry” meals that take less than 15 minutes to make, each makes enough for 6 people.</p>
    
       <p>Key step (especially for simple pastas like these) - tossing the sauce with the cooked pasta and a 
        splash of pasta cooking water. The fat in the sauce reacts with the starch in the cooking water, 
        thickening the sauce and making it stick to the pasta strands. This is the proper way to make 
        pasta - no self respecting Italian or restaurant would ever skip this step!</p>
